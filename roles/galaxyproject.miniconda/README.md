# galaxyproject.miniconda

An [Ansible][ansible] role for installing and managing [Conda][conda] using [Miniforge][miniforge], [micromamba][micromamba], [Miniconda][miniconda] or [Anaconda][anaconda]. Additionally, the role can
manage the creation of a [Conda][conda] environment that can be used to create a [venv][venv] for [Galaxy][galaxy].

> [!WARNING]
> Use of Miniconda and Anaconda by those at organizations with more than 200 employees or contractors (including Affiliates) requires a [paid Anaconda Business license](https://www.anaconda.com/pricing).

## Requirements

A [Conda][conda]-compatible version of Linux or macOS is required.

## Role Variables

See [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) for a full list.

The only required variable is `miniconda_prefix`, the root of the Conda installation.

The following two variables can be used to select the Conda installer and executable:

- `miniconda_distribution`: the values can be `miniforge` (default), `micromamba`, `miniconda` or `anaconda`
- `miniconda_executable`: the default value depend on the value of `miniconda_distribution`
  - `mamba`: when the distribution is _miniforge_
  - `micromamba`: when the distribution is _micromamba_
  - `conda`: when the distribution is _miniconda_ or _anaconda_

To create arbitrary conda environments, use the variable `miniconda_conda_environments` as shown in the defaults, or the
example below. The role will also update these environments if you change their list of packages or package versions.

To create an env named `_galaxy_` for creating a venv for [Galaxy][galaxy], set `galaxy_conda_create_env` to `true`. You
can then use `{{ miniconda_prefix }}/envs/_galaxy_/bin/virtualenv` as the value to `galaxy_virtualenv_command` in
[galaxyproject.galaxy][galaxy-role]. This is particularly useful if you need a cross-platform copy of Python and
Galaxy's venv to be deployed on a shared filesystem between a Galaxy server and cluster that may not have matching OS
distributions and versions.

## Terms of Service (ToS) for Conda Channels

Some Conda channels require explicit acceptance of their Terms of Service (ToS) before you can use them.

### Configuring ToS Acceptance

You can pre-accept the ToS for specific channels by setting the following variables in your playbook or inventory:

```yaml
miniconda_tos_channels:
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
  - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r

miniconda_tos_packages:
  - conda-anaconda-tos  # required for Miniforge and older versions of Miniconda/Anaconda
```

> **Important:** The `galaxyproject.miniconda` role **does not accept any Terms of Service automatically**.
> If you need to use channels that require ToS acceptance, you must configure the variables above explicitly.

### Legal Note

Packages from these `main` and `r` channels are subject to the
[Anaconda Repository Terms of Service](https://www.anaconda.com/legal/terms/terms-of-service).

Among other restrictions, the ToS prohibits:

* heavy commercial use without a license, and
* mirroring by third parties for commercial purposes.

### ToS Support by Distribution

* `miniconda`: Supported out of the box in recent versions.
* `anaconda`: Supported out of the box in recent versions.
* `miniforge`: Supported when `miniconda_tos_packages: [conda-anaconda-tos]` is defined.
* `micromamba`: Not supported.

## Dependencies

None
